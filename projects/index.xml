      <description>Outline Link to heading Abstract Introduction Literature Review Methods Results Discussion Conclusion References Abstract Link to heading As climate change increases the intensity of storms, cities must improve their urban infrastructure to adapt to severe environmental disasters. The present study investigated six factors in Houston’s urban design to understand the city’s vulnerability to flooding: precipitation patterns, storm sewer systems, pavements, land use, topography, and socioeconomic demographics. When comparing the findings for each factor, we found that low-income Hispanic, White, and African American communities were more likely to face flood risks; these communities had higher numbers living in industrial and commercial regions along the coast, which are prone to severe flooding but face ineffective storm drainage due to prominent infrastructure made from impervious surfaces (concrete, asphalt, etc.</description>

      <description>Here is the Project 3 Git Link.&#xA;Outline Link to heading Overview How it Works Game Play Video Tutorial Coding Process Takeaways Overview Link to heading The objective of this project was to build an interactive &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; with randomly generated, explorable dungeon maps based on a 2D grid of tiles. You have probably come across games that use this map style, such as Pokémon, Fire Emblem, or Stardew Valley! These games typically use graphical tiles to create a more colorful and lively game experience, but for this project, my partner and I utilized text based tiles.</description>

      <description>Outline Link to heading Overview Method Maps Suitability Analysis Vulnerability NDVI Conclusion Poster Sources Overview Link to heading The objective of this project was to determine areas in Los Angeles in need of tree coverage. We simulated a presentation of our report as though we were addressing the Los Angeles City Planning Commission. In conclusion, we found that Los Angeles was highly suitable for planting trees, and additionally, it was also in need of trees (for their shade) to ensure a sustainable environment.</description>
